# MPECopt - a fast and robust solver for optimization problems with complementarity constraints

## Running the macMPEC benchmark

1. Download all mpecMPEC files from the following link: https://cloud.syscop.de/s/rBnTMocFoLcNLWG
The *.json files should be in benchmark\macmpec\macMPEC
2.  
a) To load an solve a single problem from the benchmark run `solve_single_macmpec_problem.m`
b) To solve the whole problem set run `run_macmpec_experiments_all.m`
